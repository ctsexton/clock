# clock

> Built with Vue.js and Vuex. Responsive UI that adapts to all screen sizes. Click the cog icon to access the settings panel. All changes are auto-saved to local storage - so the user can reload the page or even restart their browser and keep their settings... without requiring a sign-up process. Neat!

### To Do:
 - refactor components to keep all settings data together and create open/closing option boxes

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
