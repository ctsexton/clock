# Dashboard

> A simple dashboard app with settings panel. Built on Vue.js, Vuex & Nuxt.

## Guide:
This simple web app demonstrates some straight-forward state management in Vue. The settings panel allows the user to change the timezone, colors and sizes of the clock elements. The color selector is a custom built Hue/Saturation/Lightness set of sliders. The timezone selector includes an autocomplete feature that translates between the timezone format "Continent/City_Name" and a more friendly, readable format "City Name, Country". 

### The Repo:
This is a standard Nuxt project. 
 - Main page is at /pages/index.vue
 - Anything else of interest is located in /components
